/**
 * Cross-field rule for backfilling promotion history (#1431 PR 2 of 2).
 *
 * The issue's own open question: what happens when a backfilled promotion
 * contradicts the athlete's existing history around it — a 2019 blue-belt
 * row inserted after an existing black-belt row, say. The product decision
 * (recorded explicitly, not assumed): REFUSE, with a specific error naming
 * the row it disagrees with. Silently allowing it would let the timeline
 * contradict itself; a soft warning would let an owner click through a
 * contradiction without noticing.
 *
 * **Scope, deliberately narrow**: each kind (`belt`, `stripe`) is checked
 * against its OWN same-kind neighbours only — a stripe row is never
 * cross-checked against belt rows, even though a real belt promotion
 * resets stripes to 0. Modelling that interaction would mean either
 * auto-inserting a companion stripe-reset row on every belt backfill (not
 * what the owner asked for) or rejecting historically-accurate stripe
 * entries whenever an unrelated belt row happens to sit between them.
 * Neither is what "add a past promotion" should feel like for someone
 * transcribing an incomplete paper register.
 *
 * A row with NO same-kind predecessor (or successor) is unconstrained on
 * that side — that is the legitimate "earliest/latest known event of this
 * kind" case, most commonly an athlete who joined already holding a belt
 * or stripe count Budojo never generated a row for.
