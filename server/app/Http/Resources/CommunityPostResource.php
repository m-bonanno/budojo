/**
 * Wire shape for a single community post (#612, M9 PR-B server). The
 * SPA consumes this in two surfaces:
 *
 * - `/dashboard/me/feed` — the athlete-portal timeline (PR-B2 client).
 * - The owner-side moderation view (no UI yet — owners view + delete
 *   posts via the same payload in V2 when they need to moderate).
 *
 * `created_by` carries the author's identity flair shape so the SPA's
 * `<app-user-flair>` component (PR-D) can render the
 * "Mario Rossi · @mariobjj · 🟦 Blue" line. Belt comes from the
 * linked athlete row — which since #747 an OWNER can have too, by
 * opting into "train at this academy". Null means only "this person
 * has no athlete row here", and the SPA renders the owner variant of
 * the flair; it does not mean "this person is staff".
 *
 * Reactions / comments / rsvps counts are surfaced from the
 * `withCount()` aggregations the Action eager-loads. PR-C (reactions)
 * and PR-D (comments) will start surfacing non-zero values; today
 * they're all zero.
