/**
 * Import a roster from a CSV (#1346).
 *
 * The thing standing between installing Budojo and getting any value out of it
 * is sixty trips through the "new athlete" form. This is that, once.
 *
 * **It creates athletes the same way the form does** — through
 * `CreateAthleteAction`, which is exactly the future its docblock named. Not
 * because the code is prettier that way, but because writing rows straight
 * into SQLite would skip the observers, the academy counters and the audit
 * trail, and produce a roster subtly unlike one typed in by hand. The bugs
 * from that surface weeks later and never look like an import problem.
 *
 * **Every row is validated against `AthleteFieldRules`** — the same definition
 * of a valid athlete the form uses, so a rule added there cannot silently skip
 * the path that creates sixty records at once.
 *
 * **The dry run is the product, not a debug flag.** A file's dates are
 * ambiguous (`03/04/2019`), its belts are in another language, and its columns
 * are named by whoever made the sheet. No parser resolves that reliably; what
 * resolves it is showing the owner exactly what would be written, and letting
 * them look, before anything is.
