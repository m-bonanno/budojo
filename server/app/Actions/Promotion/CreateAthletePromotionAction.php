     * same as `UpdateAthletePromotionRecordedAtAction`: never through
     * `Athlete::$belt` / `Athlete::$stripes`, so it cannot trigger
     * `AthleteObserver` — no spurious `CommunityPost`, no notification
     * fanout, and the athlete's CURRENT belt or stripes cannot be dragged
     * around by adding a row to their past. `recordedByUserId` is always
     * the caller transcribing the register now, never a guess at who
     * recorded the real-world event (#1431).
     *
     * Chain consistency (does this row contradict its neighbours) is
     * already enforced by `StoreAthletePromotionRequest` before this runs
     * — by the time `execute()` is called, the row is known-consistent
     * and this is a straight insert.
