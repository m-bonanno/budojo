/**
 * Counts the academy's *scheduled* training days that have already

 * attendance is compared against THIS denominator, not the calendar-day
 * count: "12 days trained out of 18 scheduled" answers the instructor's
 * question, "12 days out of 30" doesn't.
 *
 * From #1094 this consumes the full **schedule history** instead of a
 * single `trainingDays` snapshot — so a mid-month schedule change (e.g.
 * Mon/Wed/Fri up to May 31, Tue/Thu from Jun 1) yields the correct
 * per-segment denominator instead of silently rewriting May to today's
 * schedule. Each day in the month is checked against the schedule that
 * was in effect on THAT day.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there's no schedule history at all, OR when the
 * **entire history** is the `training_days: null` sentinel (i.e.
 * "schedule not configured anywhere ever"). A configured row OUTSIDE
 * the visible range is enough to switch the result from `null` to `0`
 * — the denominator is then "known to be zero," not "unknown." The
 * caller treats `null` as "hide the percentage UI; show the raw count".
 *
 * `month` is 1..12 (calendar), not 0-indexed.
 *
 * `today` is injectable so the unit tests are deterministic; in the
 * component we just call `new Date()` at compute-time — month boundaries
 * carry the precision, no second-level needed.
