/**
 * How an athlete looks on a row, in one place (#1458).
 *
 * The roster and the daily attendance list draw the same people. They used to
 * draw them differently: the roster with a belt-coloured spine down the left
 * edge, an avatar and an age chip; attendance with the belt as a chip in a
 * column of its own and nothing else. Same person, two identities, and a
 * reader moving between the two screens had to re-learn the row.
 *
 * So the identity is a component and the pages keep only what is theirs — the
 * roster's payment chip and actions, attendance's present/absent control.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: anything either page can decide alone. The
 * spine's tooltip, the age chip and the avatar are the athlete; a status chip
 * or a social link is a page's editorial choice about what else is worth
 * saying, and those project in through `<ng-content>`.
