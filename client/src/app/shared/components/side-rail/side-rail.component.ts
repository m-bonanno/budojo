/**

 * (extracted from the duplicated rail chrome shipped in #1110 / #1112).
 * Presentational: the host supplies the same `tabs` it feeds the bottom-nav
 * plus a role-specific `brand` + `profile`, and an account-side `secondary`
 * group at its foot.
 *
 * a11y:
 * - the host element is the `role="navigation"` landmark (label via `ariaLabel`);
 *   tabs are `<a routerLinkActive>` carrying `aria-current="page"` on the active route.
 * - the keyboard focus ring comes from the GLOBAL `:focus-visible` rule
 *   (`budojo-variants.scss`, the `--budojo-focus-ring-*` tokens) — the rail's
 *   interactive elements only re-declare `border-radius` so the ring rounds to
 *   their own shape (#1114 canon: no local outline). Fixes #1119 — every
 *   interactive rail element now shows a focus ring, not only the brand.
 * - the brand link carries no `aria-label`, so its accessible name is the
 *   visible brand text (WCAG 2.5.3 label-in-name — #1119: the owner academy
 *   name is no longer hidden behind a generic "go to home" label).
