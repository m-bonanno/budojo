/**
 * The visual-verification harness (#1460), driven by `make shot`.
 *
 * Every UI change is supposed to get a real-browser look before it is pushed
 * — `docs/development/visual-verification.md` has said so for a long time —
 * but the recipe was "write a throwaway spec", which meant inventing fixtures
 * and remembering to delete it afterwards. Half the time the throwaway spec
 * was the bug: a stale one shipped `<<<<<<< HEAD` to four mobile cards with
 * both gates green.
 *
 * So this one is permanent, takes the route from the environment, and shoots
 * the two widths the canon cares about. It runs against whatever the dev
 * backend is serving, which is the point: real data, real empty states.
 *
 *   make shot PAGE=/dashboard/athletes
 */
const route = Cypress.env('PAGE') ?? '/dashboard/athletes';

/**
 * The shell's own calls, stubbed so the page renders at all.
 *
 * `visitAuthenticated` seeds a fake token, which the real dev backend
 * rejects — the app then redirects to login and the shot is a blank page.
 * That is exactly what the first version of this harness produced, and the
 * filenames looked fine, which is how it nearly shipped.
 *
 * The catch-all keeps every other endpoint quiet. **Pages render their EMPTY
 * state**: this harness is for chrome, spacing and responsive behaviour. A
 * shot that needs rows still needs a spec with fixtures — say so rather than
 * pretending otherwise.
