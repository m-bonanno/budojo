// The two dead-style traps, as a check instead of a grep (#1472).
//
// `.claude/gotchas.md` describes both, and they are the same bug seen from
// opposite sides:
//
//   1. a class in a template with no rule — the element renders, unstyled,
//      and nothing looks broken in a test or a screenshot review;
//   2. a rule with no element — the styling is simply never applied.
//
// Between them they account for #1301, #1320, #1328, #1355 and #1428. The
// gotcha's own advice was "grep the SCSS before committing", and it noted
// that nothing lints it. A guard you have to remember is the guard that was
// missing on each of those five occasions.
//
// Deliberately NOT a CSS parser. It reads the two files as text, which is
// enough for the shape this codebase writes — BEM blocks with `&__element`
// nesting — and wrong in ways that are always SAFE: anything it cannot
// resolve it treats as used, so it under-reports rather than crying wolf. A
// check that fires on healthy code gets muted, and then it is worth nothing.
