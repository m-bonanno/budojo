# Cypress against the running dev server, without the rebuild race.
#
#   ./e2e.sh                          # every spec
#   ./e2e.sh athletes-sort            # one spec, by basename
#   ./e2e.sh athletes-sort,attendance # several
#
# Why this exists: `test-client.sh` runs `prettier --write`, which rewrites
# source files, which makes `ng serve` rebuild. Cypress started in that window
# runs against the PREVIOUS bundle and fails on assertions that are correct —
# or worse, passes on code you just changed. It cost three false failures in
# one afternoon before anyone wrote it down, and every time the reflex is to
# suspect the change rather than the clock.
#
# So: wait for the server to answer, then wait for it to STOP changing, and
# only then run. Same container and flags the docs prescribe, in one place.
