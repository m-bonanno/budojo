/**
 * The OAuth client, from the artefact rather than from the machine (#1331).
 *
 * This used to read `process.env` at **launch**, on the end user's computer,
 * while its own comment claimed the values were substituted at build time.
 * Nothing substituted anything — `tsc` performs no substitution,
 * `electron-builder.yml` defined nothing, `release.yml` never mentioned the
 * variables — so the client was always null in a shipped build and the whole
 * of #1301 was unreachable in every installer. Setting the two GitHub secrets,
 * the obvious fix, would have changed nothing.
 *
 * Now the values ride in the artefact's own `package.json`, injected by
 * `electron-builder`'s `extraMetadata` at package time. That is the mechanism
 * the release already uses for the version number, so it is one channel rather
 * than a second one to keep working.
 *
 * @param baked `package.json` from the packaged app — whatever `extraMetadata`
 *              put there, unvalidated, because it is JSON assembled by a shell
 *              command and a mis-quoted argument can land any shape
 * @param env   development only. `main.ts` passes `process.env` under
 *              `ELECTRON_DEV` and an **empty object** otherwise, which is what
 *              makes a shipped build unable to be influenced by anything on
 *              the machine it runs on — not merely unlikely to be
