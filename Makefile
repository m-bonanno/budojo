# Budojo — one front door for the commands we actually run.
#
# This file is an INDEX, not a second implementation. Every target delegates to
# the script or tool that already owns the behaviour (`.claude/scripts/*.sh`,
# npm, docker compose). Nothing here reimplements a gate, a container name or a
# flag — two sources of truth is how a helper drifts from the thing it wraps.
# If a target needs real logic, it belongs in a script under `.claude/scripts/`
# and the target calls it.
#
# `make` alone prints the list.
#
# Windows shell resolution — measured, not assumed:
#   * `SHELL := bash` is IGNORED by Make on Windows. It silently falls back to
#     cmd.exe, where grep/sed/test do not exist, and every target dies with
#     "'grep' is not recognized".
#   * A bare `bash.exe` resolves to **WSL** when make is invoked from
#     PowerShell — a different machine as far as docker, npm and Windows paths
#     are concerned. Silently running the gates over there would be worse than
#     failing.
# Deriving the shell from `git --exec-path` lands on Git Bash from both
# PowerShell and Git Bash, without hardcoding an install location. Verified
# from both shells.

#
# Elsewhere (Linux, macOS) make defaults SHELL to `/bin/sh`, and `.SHELLFLAGS`
# below passes the bash-only `-o pipefail`. On Fedora that happens to work
# because /bin/sh is a symlink to bash; on Debian/Ubuntu — including the
# ubuntu-latest CI runners — /bin/sh is dash and every target dies with
# "Illegal option -o pipefail". Measured, not assumed. Pin bash explicitly.
